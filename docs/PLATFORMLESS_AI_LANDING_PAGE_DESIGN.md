```
What is Platformless AI?
```

**Intro Paragraph**:
```
Platformless AI is a decentralized peer-to-peer network for accessing AI models
without trusting a centralized company. Unlike OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google,
there's no platform that can censor your prompts, access your data, or deplatform you.
```

**Two-Column Comparison**:

**Left Column: "Traditional AI Platforms"**
```
❌ Trust the company with your data
❌ Accept their terms and censorship rules
❌ Pay their markup prices
❌ Risk deplatforming
```

**Right Column: "Platformless AI"**
```
✅ End-to-end encryption (your data, your keys)
✅ Smart contract payments (trustless settlement)
✅ P2P model access (no platform gatekeepers)
✅ Open source (verify everything)
```

**Bottom Text**:
```
Built by Fabstir, powered by Base L2, secured by STARK proofs.
```

**Design Notes**:
- Background: Slightly lighter than main background (use `#260048` dark purple for subtle distinction)
- Two columns: Equal width, side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile
- Left column: Red X marks using `#a93a2a` (error red), slightly desaturated
- Right column: Green checkmarks using `#48a437` (success green), highlighted
- Cards: Border `#3e3e40` (neutrals border), subtle shadow, hover effect with border color shift to `#9d50bc` (primary light)
- Bottom text: Small, `#ababae` (copy) color, centered

### **GENERAL FAQ**

---

#### **Q1: What is Platformless AI?**

**Answer**:

Platformless AI is a decentralized peer-to-peer network for accessing AI models without trusting a centralized company.

When you use traditional AI platforms like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google, you're forced to:
- Trust them with your private data
- Accept their content moderation policies
- Pay their markup prices
- Hope they don't ban your account

Platformless AI eliminates these risks through:

**End-to-End Encryption**: Your prompts and responses are encrypted on your device before being sent. GPU providers, storage nodes, and blockchain observers cannot read your content. Only you hold the decryption keys.

**Smart Contract Payments**: Jobs are assigned and payments are settled automatically via smart contracts on Base L2. No platform takes a cut. No middleman can freeze your funds.

**P2P Model Access**: Connect directly to GPU providers running open-weight models. No centralized platform decides which models you can access or what you can ask them.

**Open Source**: All code is auditable on GitHub. You can verify exactly how encryption works, how payments are processed, and how your data is handled.

**Censorship-Resistant**: No single entity can deplatform you, filter your prompts, or alter your results. The network operates without central control.

Think of it as "Uber for AI" but truly decentralized - no company in the middle, just smart contracts coordinating between users and GPU providers.

#### **Q2: Why "platformless"?**

**Answer**:

The word "platformless" captures what makes this approach fundamentally different from traditional AI services.

**The Problem with Platforms**:

Every major AI service today (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) is a **platform** - a centralized company that sits between you and the AI models. This creates several problems:

**Trust Requirement**: You must trust the platform won't misuse your data, leak your prompts, or train models on your private conversations.

**Censorship**: Platforms decide what questions you can ask and what answers you receive. They filter "unsafe" content based on their policies, not yours.

**Single Point of Failure**: If the platform goes down, changes its terms, raises prices, or bans your account - you have no recourse.

**Markup Pricing**: Platforms add significant margins on top of compute costs because they're businesses seeking profit.

**Deplatforming Risk**: Your access can be revoked at any time, for any reason, with no appeal process.

**Why "Platformless" Works**:

Platformless AI replaces the centralized platform with:
- **Smart contracts** for coordination (trustless, automated, censorship-resistant)
- **P2P connections** for model access (direct provider-to-user)
- **End-to-end encryption** for privacy (no intermediary can read your data)
- **Decentralized storage** for conversation history (S5 network, not company servers)

The **infrastructure is platformless** - no company controls it, no middleman extracts rent, no gatekeeper decides who can participate.

You still access it via this website (platformlessai.com), but that's just documentation and a UI. The actual AI inference happens peer-to-peer, payments happen via smart contracts, and data storage is decentralized.

**The Paradox Explained**:

"Wait, isn't platformlessai.com itself a platform?"

The website is centralized (DNS, hosting), but it's just a **window into the platformless infrastructure**. If this website disappeared tomorrow, you could still:
- Use the open-source SDK directly
- Deploy your own UI
- Access the same smart contracts and P2P network
- Run your own node

The platform (this website) is **replaceable and optional**. The infrastructure (smart contracts, P2P nodes, encryption) is **platformless and permanent**.

---

#### **Q3: How does it work?**

**Answer**:

Platformless AI coordinates AI inference through smart contracts, peer-to-peer networking, and cryptographic proofs. Here's the end-to-end flow:

**1. Discovery Phase**:
- You browse available models and GPU providers via the SDK
- Smart contracts track which providers are online and their pricing
- You select a model (e.g., TinyLlama, Mistral, etc.) and price point

**2. Payment & Job Creation**:
- You deposit funds (ETH, USDC, or FAB tokens) into a smart contract escrow
- A "job" is created on-chain with your payment, selected model, and encrypted session ID
- Smart contracts assign your job to an available GPU provider

**3. Encrypted Session Initialization**:
- Your device generates a unique encryption key for this session
- The GPU provider's public key is retrieved from the blockchain
- A secure encrypted channel is established (XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD)

**4. Inference Request**:
- Your prompt is encrypted on your device before leaving
- Encrypted prompt is sent directly to the GPU provider via WebSocket (P2P)
- Provider receives encrypted data but **cannot read it**

**5. Model Inference**:
- Provider decrypts the prompt using the shared session key
- Model generates a response (e.g., 500 tokens)
- Response is encrypted before being sent back

**6. Proof of Work**:
- Every 1000 tokens, the provider generates a **STARK proof** proving computation occurred
- Proof (~221KB) is stored on **S5 decentralized storage**
- Only the proof hash (32 bytes) is submitted to the blockchain

**7. Payment Settlement**:
- Smart contract verifies the proof hash matches the S5-stored proof
- Payment is automatically released from escrow to the provider
- Any remaining deposit is returned to you

**8. Storage**:
- Your encrypted conversation is stored on **S5** (decentralized storage, like IPFS)
- You can retrieve it later using your private key
- No centralized server stores your data

**Key Technologies**:
- **Base L2**: Ethereum Layer 2 for fast, cheap transactions
- **Smart Contracts**: JobMarketplace, NodeRegistry, ProofSystem (trustless coordination)
- **STARK Proofs**: Risc0 zkVM generates cryptographic proofs of computation
- **S5 Storage**: Decentralized content-addressed storage (powered by Sia)
- **XChaCha20-Poly1305**: Military-grade authenticated encryption
- **WebSocket**: Real-time bidirectional communication for streaming responses

**What You Don't Need**:
- ❌ No account signup
- ❌ No email/phone verification
- ❌ No KYC
- ❌ No API keys (that can be revoked)
- ❌ No credit card

**What You Do Need**:
- ✅ Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- ✅ Small amount of ETH on Base L2 (for gas fees)
- ✅ Payment tokens (ETH, USDC, or FAB)

#### **Q4: Is my data private?**

**Answer**:

**Yes - end-to-end encryption by default.** Your prompts and responses are encrypted before leaving your device, and only you hold the decryption keys.

**What "End-to-End Encryption" Means**:

Traditional AI platforms see everything you send them in plaintext:
- Your prompts (input)
- Model responses (output)
- Conversation history
- Usage patterns

They claim to protect your data, but you must **trust them** to keep that promise.

Platformless AI uses **cryptographic end-to-end encryption** where:
- Encryption happens **on your device** (not the server)
- Only **you** have the decryption key
- GPU providers, storage nodes, and blockchain observers see **only encrypted data**

**Encryption Details**:

**Algorithm**: XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)
- Same encryption used by Signal, WireGuard, and Zcash
- Immune to timing attacks, prevents tampering
- Includes authentication (proves data wasn't modified in transit)

**Key Exchange**: Ephemeral-Static ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman)
- Your device generates a unique encryption key for each session
- Keys are exchanged using the GPU provider's public key (from blockchain)
- Even if long-term keys are compromised, past sessions remain secure (forward secrecy)

**Session Keys**: Fresh keys for every conversation
- Generated randomly (32 bytes of entropy)
- Stored in memory only (never written to disk)
- Discarded when session ends

**What This Protects Against**:

✅ **Eavesdropping**: Network intermediaries (ISPs, VPN providers) see encrypted data
✅ **Data Leaks**: Even if S5 storage is breached, conversations are encrypted
✅ **Malicious Nodes**: GPU providers cannot read your prompts
✅ **Blockchain Analysis**: On-chain data shows only hashes, not content
✅ **Subpoenas/Warrants**: No plaintext data exists to hand over

**What This Doesn't Protect**:

❌ **Your Device**: If your device is compromised (malware, keylogger), encryption can't help
❌ **GPU Provider Metadata**: Providers know your IP address, session duration, token count
❌ **Blockchain Metadata**: Transaction history (job IDs, payment amounts) is public

**Comparison to Other Services**:

| Service | Data Privacy | Trust Model |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **OpenAI/Anthropic** | No E2E encryption | Trust the company |
| **Local LLMs** | Fully private | Trust yourself |
| **Platformless AI** | E2E encrypted | Cryptographic proofs (trustless) |

**Verifying Encryption**:

You can verify encryption is working by:
1. Inspecting WebSocket traffic (browser DevTools) - you'll see encrypted messages
2. Checking S5 storage - conversation data is ciphertext
3. Reviewing blockchain transactions - only hashes are submitted
4. Auditing the open-source code on GitHub

**Performance Impact**:

Encryption overhead is negligible:
- Session initialization: ~10ms (one-time)
- Per-message encryption: <1ms
- Per-message decryption: <1ms

Compare this to model inference (500ms - 5sec) and network latency (20-100ms). The security benefits far outweigh the minimal performance cost.

#### **Q5: What makes this different from OpenAI/Anthropic?**

**Answer**:

The fundamental difference is **who controls your AI experience**: a centralized company vs. trustless smart contracts.

**Detailed Comparison**:

| Feature | Traditional Platforms (OpenAI, Anthropic) | Platformless AI |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Data Privacy** | Company sees all prompts/responses | End-to-end encrypted, only you have keys |
| **Censorship** | Platform filters "unsafe" content | Censorship-resistant, no gatekeeper |
| **Account Control** | Can ban/suspend your account anytime | Wallet-based access, no accounts to ban |
| **Pricing** | Platform sets prices + markup | Market-driven pricing (80% cheaper) |
| **Model Access** | Limited to platform's approved models | Any open-weight model providers host |
| **Data Storage** | Company servers (terms can change) | S5 decentralized storage (you control) |
| **API Keys** | Can be revoked, rate-limited | No API keys (wallet-based auth) |
| **Trust Model** | Must trust company promises | Cryptographic proofs (trustless) |
| **Verification** | Closed source, can't verify claims | Open source, audit everything |
| **Deplatforming** | One email and you're banned | Impossible to deplatform |
| **Content Policy** | Must accept their terms | No terms to accept |
| **Intermediary** | Company sits between you and models | Peer-to-peer direct access |
| **Single Point of Failure** | Platform down = service unavailable | Decentralized (no single point of failure) |

**Real-World Scenarios Where This Matters**:

**Scenario 1: Political/Sensitive Research**
- **Traditional Platform**: Your prompts about controversial topics may be flagged, filtered, or reported.
- **Platformless AI**: End-to-end encryption means no one can see what you're researching.

**Scenario 2: Business/Proprietary Data**
- **Traditional Platform**: Your company's confidential data is sent to OpenAI servers in plaintext.
- **Platformless AI**: Data is encrypted before leaving your infrastructure. GPU providers cannot access it.

**Scenario 3: Terms Change**
- **Traditional Platform**: OpenAI changes pricing, adds usage restrictions, or discontinues a feature. You have no choice but to accept.
- **Platformless AI**: Smart contracts enforce terms. Providers can't unilaterally change the agreement.

**Scenario 4: Account Termination**
- **Traditional Platform**: Your account is banned (false positive, policy change, etc.). You lose access to all conversation history.
- **Platformless AI**: Wallet-based access means no "account" to ban. Your encrypted history is stored on S5 under your control.

**Who Should Use Platformless AI?**

✅ **Privacy-conscious users**: Journalists, lawyers, healthcare professionals
✅ **Researchers**: Sensitive topics, controversial questions
✅ **Businesses**: Proprietary data that can't be sent to third parties
✅ **Developers**: Building on open protocols without vendor lock-in
✅ **Crypto natives**: Already have wallets, value trustlessness
✅ **Censorship targets**: Regions with internet restrictions

**Who Might Prefer Traditional Platforms?**

- **Non-technical users**: No wallet, no crypto, just want to chat
- **Enterprise SLAs**: Need 99.9% uptime guarantees, support contracts
- **Frontier models**: OpenAI o1, Claude Opus (not yet available decentralized)
- **Zero crypto involvement**: Don't want to acquire ETH/USDC

**Bottom Line**:

Traditional platforms optimize for **convenience and ease of use**.
Platformless AI optimizes for **privacy, censorship-resistance, and trustlessness**.

If you're comfortable trusting OpenAI/Anthropic with your data, traditional platforms may be simpler. But if you value privacy, sovereignty, and open infrastructure - Platformless AI is the only option that delivers on those promises with cryptographic guarantees.

#### **Q1: How do I start using Platformless AI?**

**Answer**:

Platformless AI is currently in **beta**. Here's how to get started once it launches:

**Step 1: Get a Crypto Wallet**

You'll need an Ethereum-compatible wallet to interact with smart contracts:

**Browser Wallets** (easiest for beginners):
- **MetaMask**: Most popular, browser extension
- **Rainbow Wallet**: Mobile-first, great UX
- **Coinbase Wallet**: If you already use Coinbase

**Download**: Visit metamask.io and install the browser extension
**Setup**: Create a new wallet, **securely store your seed phrase** (12/24 words)
**⚠️ Critical**: Never share your seed phrase with anyone. This is your master password.

**Step 2: Get ETH on Base L2**

You need a small amount of ETH on Base L2 (Ethereum Layer 2) for:
- Gas fees (transaction costs, ~$0.01 per transaction)
- Payments to GPU providers (or use USDC/FAB tokens)

**Option A - Bridge from Ethereum Mainnet**:
1. Visit bridge.base.org
2. Connect your wallet
3. Bridge ETH from Ethereum mainnet → Base L2
4. Wait ~5 minutes for confirmation

**Option B - Buy Directly on Base**:
1. Use Coinbase (supports Base natively)
2. Buy ETH or USDC
3. Withdraw to your wallet on Base L2 network

**Option C - Use a Faucet (Testnet Only)**:
- For Base Sepolia testnet: Visit faucet.quicknode.com
- Get free test ETH to experiment (not real money)

**Step 3: Visit Platformless AI**

Once you have a wallet and ETH on Base:
1. Go to **platformlessai.com**
2. Click **"Connect Wallet"**
3. Approve the connection (this doesn't cost anything)

**Step 4: Browse Models & Providers**

The UI will show:
- Available models (TinyLlama, Mistral, etc.)
- GPU providers (location, uptime, pricing)
- Estimated cost per 1000 tokens

Select a model and provider based on:
- **Price**: Lower cost per token
- **Latency**: Geographic proximity (lower ping)
- **Reputation**: Host uptime, completed jobs

**Step 5: Start a Conversation**

1. Deposit funds into escrow (e.g., $1 worth of ETH/USDC)
2. Start chatting with the AI model
3. Responses stream in real-time (like ChatGPT)
4. Encryption happens automatically (you don't have to do anything)

**Step 6: Your Conversations are Saved**

All conversations are:
- Encrypted with your wallet's key
- Stored on S5 decentralized storage
- Accessible anytime you reconnect your wallet

#### **Q2: What AI models are available?**

**Answer**:

Platformless AI supports **open-weight models** in GGUF format that GPU providers choose to host. Unlike closed platforms (OpenAI, Anthropic), model availability is determined by the decentralized marketplace, not a single company.

**Currently Available Models** (Beta):

**Small/Fast Models**:
- **TinyLlama 1.1B**: Ultra-fast, cheap, good for simple tasks
- **TinyVicuna 1B**: Similar performance, optimized for chat

**These are primarily for testing during beta. Larger models will be added as the network scales.**

**Coming Soon** (Post-Beta):

**7B Parameter Models**:
- **Mistral 7B**: High-quality open model, excellent reasoning
- **Llama 3 8B**: Meta's latest, strong performance
- **Gemma 7B**: Google's open model

**13B+ Parameter Models**:
- **Llama 3 70B**: Approaching GPT-4 level quality
- **Mixtral 8x7B**: Mixture-of-experts model (efficient)

**Specialized Models**:
- **Code models**: CodeLlama, StarCoder
- **Multilingual**: BLOOM, mGPT
- **Uncensored variants**: Versions without RLHF safety tuning

**Why GGUF Format?**

GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) is optimized for:
- ✅ Efficient CPU/GPU inference
- ✅ Quantization (4-bit, 5-bit, 8-bit)
- ✅ Fast loading times
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility

Most open models can be converted to GGUF using `llama.cpp` tools.

**Model Governance**:

Models must be **approved** by the ModelRegistry smart contract before providers can host them. This prevents:
- ❌ Malicious models (malware, data exfiltration)
- ❌ Copyright-infringing models
- ❌ Models pretending to be others (fake "GPT-4")

Approval process:
1. Community proposes a model (model name + hash)
2. Governance vote (FAB token holders)
3. If approved, model is added to registry
4. Providers can stake and host it

**How Providers Choose Models**:

GPU providers select models based on:
- **Demand**: Popular models earn more
- **Hardware**: Larger models need more VRAM
- **Profitability**: Balance compute cost vs. market pricing

**What You CAN'T Access** (Yet):

❌ **Closed models**: GPT-4, Claude Opus, Gemini Pro (API-only)
❌ **Very large models**: 100B+ parameter models (hardware limitations)
❌ **Proprietary models**: OpenAI's, Anthropic's models (not open)

**Future: Multi-Modal Models**:

Planned support for:
- **Image generation**: Stable Diffusion, FLUX
- **Vision models**: LLaVA, GPT-4 Vision clones
- **Audio/TTS**: Whisper, Bark, Coqui TTS

**How to Request a Model**:

1. Check if the model exists in GGUF format
2. Propose it via governance forum
3. Community votes on approval
4. Once approved, providers can host it

**Search for Models**:

In the UI, you can filter by:
- **Size**: 1B, 7B, 13B, 70B parameters
- **Type**: Chat, code, multilingual
- **Quantization**: 4-bit, 8-bit, full precision
- **Provider**: Which hosts are running it

**Pricing by Model Size**:

Larger models cost more per token (more compute):
- **1B models**: ~$0.0001 per 1K tokens
- **7B models**: ~$0.001 per 1K tokens
- **70B models**: ~$0.01 per 1K tokens

Still **80% cheaper than OpenAI** because there's no platform markup.

---

#### **Q3: Is this cheaper than OpenAI/Anthropic?**

**Answer**:

**Yes - up to 80% cost reduction** by eliminating platform markup. You pay GPU providers directly via smart contracts.

**Price Comparison**:

| Service | Price per 1M Tokens (Input) | Price per 1M Tokens (Output) |
|---------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **OpenAI GPT-4** | $30.00 | $60.00 |
| **Anthropic Claude 3 Opus** | $15.00 | $75.00 |
| **OpenAI GPT-3.5** | $0.50 | $1.50 |
| **Platformless AI (7B)** | $0.10 - $0.20 | $0.10 - $0.20 |
| **Platformless AI (70B)** | $1.00 - $2.00 | $1.00 - $2.00 |

**Why So Much Cheaper?**

Traditional AI platforms add massive markup:
- Infrastructure costs (servers, bandwidth)
- Engineering salaries (safety teams, operations)
- Marketing and sales
- Profit margins (they're for-profit businesses)

OpenAI/Anthropic pay ~$0.05 - $0.10 per 1M tokens for compute, then charge $30 - $75. **That's a 300-750x markup.**

Platformless AI:
- ✅ No platform to fund (smart contracts are code, not employees)
- ✅ Providers compete on price (marketplace dynamics)
- ✅ Users pay only compute cost + small network fee (~5%)

**Real-World Examples**:

**Example 1: Customer Support Bot**
- **Task**: 10,000 customer queries/day, 500 tokens avg per conversation
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5**: ~$75/day ($2,250/month)
- **Platformless AI (7B)**: ~$15/day ($450/month)
- **Savings**: $1,800/month (80% reduction)

**Example 2: Code Assistant**
- **Task**: 1,000 code completions/day, 1,000 tokens avg
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: ~$300/day ($9,000/month)
- **Platformless AI (70B)**: ~$60/day ($1,800/month)
- **Savings**: $7,200/month (80% reduction)

**Example 3: Personal Use**
- **Task**: 50 chats/week, 5,000 tokens avg
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5**: ~$3.75/month
- **Platformless AI (7B)**: ~$0.75/month
- **Savings**: $3/month (80% reduction)

**Additional Costs to Consider**:

**Gas Fees** (Base L2):
- Job creation: ~$0.01 per session
- Proof verification: ~$0.005 per checkpoint
- Total: ~$0.02 per session (negligible)

**Network Fee** (5%):
- Goes to protocol treasury (future development)
- Already included in provider pricing

**No Hidden Fees**:
- ❌ No subscription required
- ❌ No minimum spend
- ❌ No rate limits (pay-per-use)
- ❌ No API key fees

**Prepaid vs. Pay-As-You-Go**:

You can:
- **Deposit funds once**: Use until balance depleted
- **Top up as needed**: No commitment
- **Automatic refunds**: Unused deposit returned

**Price Discovery**:

Providers set their own pricing based on:
- Hardware costs (GPU depreciation, electricity)
- Competitive landscape (undercut rivals)
- Demand (popular models cost more)

Users choose providers by price, creating **market-driven pricing**.

**Will Prices Stay Low?**

Market forces will keep prices competitive:
- ✅ Low barriers to entry (anyone can be a provider)
- ✅ No platform lock-in (users switch providers easily)
- ✅ Transparent pricing (all rates visible on-chain)

As GPU hardware becomes cheaper (Moore's Law), prices will likely **decrease further over time**.

**Quality vs. Price**:

Cheaper doesn't mean worse:
- **Same models**: Open-weight models perform identically wherever they run
- **Same quality**: 7B Mistral on Platformless AI = 7B Mistral anywhere else
- **Lower overhead**: Decentralization reduces waste, not quality

#### **Q4: Do I need crypto/wallet to use this?**

**Answer**:

**Yes, currently.** Platformless AI requires:
1. An Ethereum-compatible wallet (MetaMask, Rainbow, etc.)
2. ETH or USDC on Base L2 (for payments and gas fees)

**Why a Wallet is Required**:

**Authentication**: Your wallet is your identity. No usernames, passwords, or accounts to manage.

**Payments**: Smart contracts need to know where to deduct funds from and refund unused deposits.

**Encryption Keys**: Your wallet's private key is used to generate encryption keys for securing conversations.

**Proof of Ownership**: Only you can access your encrypted conversation history (tied to your wallet).

**Do I Need to Be a "Crypto Expert"?**

**No.** Basic wallet usage is similar to using Venmo or PayPal:
1. Install MetaMask (5 minutes)
2. Buy $10-20 of ETH on Coinbase
3. Withdraw to your MetaMask wallet on Base L2
4. Connect wallet to Platformless AI

Most users learn this in **under 30 minutes**.

**Future: Fiat On-Ramp**:

We're exploring integrations to make this easier:
- **Credit card purchases**: Buy ETH/USDC directly in the UI (via Moonpay, Ramp)
- **Gasless transactions**: Smart wallets that sponsor gas fees
- **Email-based wallets**: Privy, Magic Link (wallet in the background)

These are planned for **post-MVP** but not yet available.

**What About Privacy?**

Crypto wallets are **pseudonymous**:
- Your wallet address (e.g., `0xABC123...`) is public on the blockchain
- It's not directly tied to your real identity (no KYC)
- However, if you buy crypto on Coinbase (KYC exchange), your address can be linked to you

**For maximum privacy**:
1. Buy crypto with cash (LocalBitcoins, Bitcoin ATM)
2. Use a privacy coin (Monero) to swap for ETH
3. Create a fresh wallet for Platformless AI (not used elsewhere)

**Can I Use This Without Touching Crypto?**

**Not yet.** The architecture fundamentally relies on:
- Smart contracts (requires on-chain transactions)
- Wallet-based encryption (requires private key)
- Trustless payments (requires blockchain settlement)

If you're uncomfortable with crypto, traditional AI platforms (OpenAI, Anthropic) may be more suitable for now.

**Beta Testing Without Real Funds**:

You can experiment on **Base Sepolia testnet** (fake ETH):
1. Get free test ETH from faucet
2. Connect to testnet in MetaMask
3. Try Platformless AI without risking real money

### **HOSTING FAQ**

---

#### **Q1: How do I become a GPU provider?**

**Answer**:

Becoming a GPU provider (host) on Platformless AI allows you to monetize your spare GPU compute by running AI models for users. Here's the complete process:

**Prerequisites**:

**Hardware Requirements**:
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with ≥8GB VRAM (RTX 3060 minimum, RTX 4090 ideal)
- **RAM**: ≥16GB system RAM (32GB+ recommended)
- **Storage**: ≥100GB free SSD space (for models)
- **Internet**: Stable connection with ≥50 Mbps upload speed
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended) or Windows with WSL2

**Software Requirements**:
- **Docker**: For running the Fabstir LLM Node
- **CUDA Drivers**: NVIDIA CUDA 12.0+ for GPU acceleration
- **Ethereum Wallet**: With private key (for signing transactions)

**Step-by-Step Setup**:

**1. Install Fabstir LLM Node**

```bash
# Download the node software
wget https://github.com/fabstir-llm-marketplace/releases/fabstir-llm-node-v8.1.2.tar.gz

# Verify checksum (security)
sha256sum fabstir-llm-node-v8.1.2.tar.gz
# Should match: 31b4b28eb07fa761d8edba9af075f4fc230b5e5d47bdc3432a71c29feb23da9f

# Extract
tar -xzf fabstir-llm-node-v8.1.2.tar.gz
cd fabstir-llm-node
```

**2. Download AI Model**

Choose a model to host (based on your GPU):

```bash
# For 8GB VRAM (TinyLlama)
wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF/resolve/main/tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.Q4_K_M.gguf

# For 16GB VRAM (Mistral 7B)
wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF/resolve/main/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf

# For 24GB+ VRAM (Llama 3 70B)
wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/llama-3-70b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf
```

**3. Configure Environment**

Create `.env` file with your settings:

```bash
# Your wallet private key (KEEP SECRET!)
HOST_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE

# Your wallet address (public)
HOST_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE

# Model configuration
MODEL_PATH=./models/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf
MODEL_NAME=TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF:mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf

# Pricing (in smallest unit: 100 = $0.0001 per token)
PRICE_PER_1K_TOKENS=2000  # $0.002 per 1K tokens

# Base L2 RPC endpoint
RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
CHAIN_ID=84532

# Contract addresses (from .env.test)
CONTRACT_JOB_MARKETPLACE=0xYOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
CONTRACT_NODE_REGISTRY=0xYOUR_REGISTRY_ADDRESS

# Node configuration
NODE_PORT=8080
WS_PORT=8080
```

**4. Register Your Host On-Chain**

Use the Host CLI tool to register:

```bash
# Register with staking (requires FAB tokens)
./fabstir-host-cli register \
  --model "TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF:mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf" \
  --stake 100 \
  --price 2000

# This will:
# 1. Stake 100 FAB tokens (refundable when you unregister)
# 2. Set your price to $0.002 per 1K tokens
# 3. Register your public key on-chain
# 4. Make you visible in the marketplace
```

**5. Start the Node**

```bash
# Run in Docker (recommended)
docker run -d \
  --gpus all \
  --name fabstir-node \
  --env-file .env \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  fabstir-llm-node:latest

# Or run directly (if you built from source)
./fabstir-llm-node
```

**6. Verify Node is Running**

Check health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy","version":"v8.1.2","model":"Mistral-7B"}
```

Check on-chain status:

```bash
./fabstir-host-cli status
# Should show: "Status: Active, Jobs Completed: 0, Earnings: 0 USDC"
```

**7. Monitor Your Node**

Watch logs for incoming jobs:

```bash
docker logs -f fabstir-node
```

You'll see:
- `📥 New job received: jobId=12345`
- `🔐 Generating STARK proof...`
- `✅ Job completed, earning 0.15 USDC`

**8. Withdraw Earnings**

Accumulated earnings are automatically deposited to your wallet via smart contracts. You can withdraw anytime:

```bash
./fabstir-host-cli withdraw --amount 10.0
# Withdraws 10 USDC to your wallet (minus gas fee)
```

**Ongoing Maintenance**:

- **Keep node running**: Use Docker restart policies or systemd
- **Monitor uptime**: Downtime reduces your reputation score
- **Update models**: Add more models to increase job opportunities
- **Upgrade software**: Install new node versions when released

**Expected Earnings**:

Depends on:
- **GPU specs**: Faster GPUs complete jobs quicker (more jobs per hour)
- **Model size**: Larger models earn more per token (but fewer jobs)
- **Uptime**: 99%+ uptime gets priority job assignment
- **Pricing**: Competitive pricing attracts more users

**Example**:
- **RTX 4090 running Mistral 7B**
- **95% uptime**
- **Pricing: $0.002 per 1K tokens**
- **Estimated earnings**: $50-200/month (depending on network demand)

**Risks**:

- **Staked tokens**: If you misbehave (fake proofs, go offline without unregistering), you can be slashed (lose stake)
- **Electricity costs**: GPU power consumption (~300W for RTX 4090)
- **Hardware depreciation**: GPU wear and tear

- Can run: 1B-3B parameter models (TinyLlama, Vicuna 1B)
- Performance: ~50 tokens/sec
- Estimated earnings: $20-50/month

**System RAM**: 16GB DDR4
**Storage**: 100GB SSD (for models + proofs)
**Internet**: 50 Mbps upload (consistent, low latency)
**Power Supply**: 650W (to handle GPU load)

**Recommended Specifications** (Mid-Tier):

**GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti (12GB VRAM) or RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM)
- Can run: 7B-13B parameter models (Mistral 7B, Llama 3 8B)
- Performance: ~150 tokens/sec
- Estimated earnings: $100-300/month

**System RAM**: 32GB DDR4/DDR5
**Storage**: 500GB NVMe SSD (faster proof generation)
**Internet**: 100 Mbps upload
**Power Supply**: 850W

**Optimal Specifications** (High-End):

**GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM) or A100 (40GB VRAM)
- Can run: 13B-70B parameter models (Llama 3 70B, Mixtral 8x7B)
- Performance: ~300 tokens/sec (RTX 4090), ~500 tokens/sec (A100)

**System RAM**: 64GB+ DDR5
**Storage**: 1TB+ NVMe SSD (multiple models)
**Internet**: 500 Mbps+ upload (gigabit fiber ideal)
**Power Supply**: 1000W+ (dual PSU for A100)

**GPU Comparison Table**:

| GPU Model | VRAM | Max Model Size | Tokens/Sec | Power Draw | Est. Monthly Earnings |
|-----------|------|----------------|------------|------------|-----------------------|
| **RTX 3060** | 12GB | 3B (Q4) | ~50 | 170W | $20-50 |
| **RTX 3070** | 8GB | 3B (Q4) | ~60 | 220W | $25-60 |
| **RTX 3080** | 10GB | 7B (Q4) | ~100 | 320W | $50-120 |
| **RTX 3090** | 24GB | 13B (Q4) | ~120 | 350W | $70-180 |
| **RTX 4070 Ti** | 12GB | 7B (Q4) | ~150 | 285W | $80-200 |
| **RTX 4080** | 16GB | 13B (Q4) | ~200 | 320W | $120-300 |
| **RTX 4090** | 24GB | 70B (Q4) | ~300 | 450W | $200-600 |
| **A100** | 40GB | 70B (Q4) | ~500 | 400W | $400-1200 |
| **H100** | 80GB | 100B+ (Q4) | ~800 | 700W | $800-2000 |

**Q4 = 4-bit quantization** (most common for efficient inference)

**Why NVIDIA Only?**

Currently, the node software requires:
- **CUDA**: NVIDIA's parallel computing platform
- **Risc0 CUDA acceleration**: For fast STARK proof generation

**AMD and Intel GPUs** are not yet supported (but planned for future releases).

**CPU-Only Hosting?**

**Not recommended.** While the node can run on CPU:
- ❌ Inference is 10-50x slower
- ❌ Proof generation takes 10-60 seconds (vs. 0.2-2 sec on GPU)
- ❌ You'll be outcompeted by GPU providers

CPU-only is fine for **testing** but not profitable for production.

**Can I Use Multiple GPUs?**

**Yes** (experimental). You can:
- Run multiple nodes on different ports (one per GPU)
- Register each as a separate host
- Earnings are independent per GPU

**Cloud GPU Providers**:

If you don't own hardware, you can rent:

| Provider | GPU Options | Cost | Profitable? |
|----------|-------------|------|-------------|
| **Vast.ai** | RTX 4090 | ~$0.40/hr | ✅ Yes ($12/day, earn $15-20/day) |
| **RunPod** | A100 | ~$1.00/hr | ✅ Yes ($24/day, earn $30-40/day) |
| **AWS** | A100 | ~$4.00/hr | ❌ No (too expensive) |
| **Lambda Labs** | RTX 4090 | ~$0.50/hr | ⚠️ Break-even |

**Profitability depends on network demand.** During high-demand periods, cloud GPUs can be profitable.

**Storage Requirements**:

- **Models**: 2-15GB per model (GGUF format)
- **Proofs**: ~221KB per checkpoint (1000 tokens)
- **Logs**: ~100MB per day

**Total**: 100GB minimum, 500GB+ recommended if hosting multiple models.

**Internet Requirements**:

**Upload Speed**: Most critical (sending responses to users)
- Minimum: 50 Mbps (for 7B models)
- Recommended: 100 Mbps+ (for 70B models)

**Latency**: Low latency improves reputation
- Under 50ms to nearest users = ideal
- Over 200ms = users may choose other providers

**Data Usage**:
- ~1-5 GB per day (depending on job volume)
- Unlimited data plan recommended

**Power and Cooling**:

**Power Draw**:
- RTX 4090: ~450W under load
- Plus system (CPU, RAM, etc.): ~150W
- Total: ~600W (~$50/month electricity at $0.12/kWh)

**Cooling**:
- Ensure good airflow (GPU temps under 80°C)
- Noisy fans during jobs (consider datacenter/basement placement)

**Profitability Calculation**:

**Example: RTX 4090 Hosting Mistral 7B**

**Costs**:
- Electricity: $50/month (~600W @ $0.12/kWh)
- Internet: $0 (assuming existing connection)
- Hardware depreciation: ~$100/month (amortized over 2 years)

**Revenue**:
- Jobs: ~500K tokens/day (average)
- Pricing: $0.002 per 1K tokens
- Earnings: ~$30/day = $900/month

**Profit**: $900 - $50 - $100 = **$750/month**

**ROI**: 18 months to break even on hardware ($1,600 GPU cost)

**Important Notes**:
- Earnings vary with network demand
- Early providers earn more (less competition)
- Reputation system rewards consistency

#### **Q3: How do I get paid for hosting models?**

**Answer**:

Payments are **automatic and trustless** via smart contracts. Here's the complete payment flow:

**1. User Creates a Job**

- User deposits funds (e.g., 10 USDC) into JobMarketplace escrow contract
- Smart contract creates a job with:
  - `jobId`: Unique identifier
  - `maxTokens`: 10,000 tokens requested
  - `pricePerToken`: 0.000002 USDC (your rate)
  - `escrowAmount`: 10 USDC (locked)

**2. Job is Assigned to You**

- Smart contract checks available hosts:
  - Model match (you're running Mistral 7B, user requested Mistral 7B)
  - Your status is "available" (not offline)
  - Your pricing is competitive
- Job is assigned to your wallet address
- You receive WebSocket notification

**3. You Complete Inference**

- User connects via WebSocket
- You decrypt prompt, run inference, encrypt response
- Stream tokens back to user in real-time

**4. Checkpoint Proof Submission**

Every 1000 tokens, you:
- Generate a **STARK proof** (cryptographic proof you did the work)
- Upload proof to S5 storage (~221KB)
- Submit proof hash + CID to blockchain

**5. Smart Contract Verifies and Releases Payment**

When your proof is submitted:
- Contract verifies proof hash matches S5 data
- Calculates earnings: `1000 tokens × $0.000002 = $0.002 USDC`
- Transfers funds from escrow to **HostEarnings contract** (your balance)
- Emits `ProofSubmitted` event (publicly visible)

**6. Your Earnings Accumulate**

- All earnings go to HostEarnings contract (not directly to your wallet)
- Balance is tracked on-chain per host address
- No minimum threshold to accumulate

**7. You Withdraw When Ready**

Withdraw anytime using Host CLI:

```bash
./fabstir-host-cli withdraw --amount 100.0
# Withdraws 100 USDC from HostEarnings to your wallet
```

Or via SDK:

```javascript
await hostManager.withdrawEarnings('100.0');
```

**Payment Timeline**:

| Event | Time | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Job assigned | Instant | WebSocket notification |
| Inference starts | <1 sec | User connects |
| Tokens generated | Real-time | Streaming response |
| Checkpoint (1000 tokens) | ~5-10 sec | Proof generated + submitted |
| Payment released | ~2-5 sec | Blockchain confirmation (Base L2 is fast) |
| Funds available | Immediately | In HostEarnings contract |
| Withdraw to wallet | ~2-5 sec | On-demand, you control timing |

**Total time from work to payment**: **Under 30 seconds** (for 1000 tokens)

**Payment Tokens**:

You receive the same token the user paid with:
- If user paid in **USDC** → you earn USDC
- If user paid in **ETH** → you earn ETH
- If user paid in **FAB** → you earn FAB

**Multi-Token Balances**:

Your HostEarnings balance tracks each token separately:
- USDC balance: 150.50
- ETH balance: 0.05
- FAB balance: 1000.00

You can withdraw each token independently.

**Automatic vs. Manual Withdrawal**:

**Automatic** (recommended):
- Set a threshold: "Withdraw when balance > 10 USDC"
- Node automatically calls `withdraw()` when threshold is met
- Saves gas by batching many jobs into one withdrawal

**Manual**:
- You decide when to withdraw (e.g., weekly)
- More control, but you pay gas fee per withdrawal

**Gas Costs**:

Withdrawals cost gas (Base L2 fees):
- ~$0.01 per withdrawal transaction
- Negligible for large withdrawals ($100+)
- Matters if withdrawing frequently with small amounts

**Slashing (Penalty System)**:

If you misbehave, your earnings can be slashed:

**Slash conditions**:
- ❌ Submitting fake/invalid proofs
- ❌ Going offline mid-job without notifying
- ❌ Failing to respond to assigned jobs

**Penalty**:
- First offense: Warning
- Second offense: 10% of staked FAB tokens slashed
- Third offense: 50% slashed + delisted from marketplace

**Slashed funds** go to protocol treasury (not the user).

**Earnings Transparency**:

All earnings are **publicly visible** on-chain:
- View on BaseScan: `https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/YOUR_ADDRESS`
- See `ProofSubmitted` events (every 1000 tokens)
- Verify payment amounts match your logs

**Tax Implications** (Consult Your Tax Advisor):

Earnings are likely considered income:
- Track all withdrawals (taxable events)
- Keep records of electricity/hardware costs (deductible)
- Report on tax returns (varies by jurisdiction)

**Disputes**:

If you believe you weren't paid correctly:
1. Check BaseScan for `ProofSubmitted` events
2. Verify proof CID matches your S5 upload
3. Check HostEarnings balance (may not have withdrawn yet)
4. If still incorrect, report in Discord #hosting channel

Smart contracts are **immutable** - incorrect payments are rare but possible bugs. Report immediately if found.

#### **Q4: What are the staking requirements?**

**Answer**:

To become a GPU provider, you must **stake FAB tokens** as collateral. This ensures hosts have "skin in the game" and discourages malicious behavior.

**Minimum Stake**:

- **100 FAB tokens** (per host registration)
- At current prices (~$0.10/FAB), this is ~$10 USD

**Why Staking is Required**:

**1. Sybil Resistance**: Prevents someone from registering 1000 fake hosts to spam the network

**2. Quality Assurance**: Only serious providers will stake capital

**3. Slashing Mechanism**: If you misbehave (fake proofs, go offline), your stake can be slashed (you lose tokens)

**4. Reputation Incentive**: Larger stakes signal commitment, improving your reputation score (more job assignments)

**Stake Amounts by Tier**:

| Stake Amount | Benefits | Risk |
|--------------|----------|------|
| **100 FAB** (min) | Can register, basic job priority | Standard slashing risk |
| **500 FAB** | +10% job priority (more assignments) | 5x larger potential loss |
| **1000 FAB** | +25% job priority, "Verified Host" badge | 10x larger potential loss |
| **5000 FAB** | +50% job priority, featured in UI | Significant capital at risk |

**Higher stake = more trust = more jobs = more earnings** (but also more to lose if slashed)

**How to Stake**:

**Option 1: Register with Stake (Host CLI)**

```bash
./fabstir-host-cli register \
  --model "TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF:mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf" \
  --stake 100
```

This will:
1. Approve NodeRegistry contract to spend your FAB tokens
2. Transfer 100 FAB to NodeRegistry escrow
3. Register your host on-chain
4. Mark you as "active" in marketplace

**Option 2: Increase Stake Later**

If you want to stake more (to increase job priority):

```bash
./fabstir-host-cli stake-more --amount 400
# Increases your stake from 100 → 500 FAB
```

**Where to Get FAB Tokens**:

**Option 1: Buy on DEX (Decentralized Exchange)**
- **Uniswap on Base**: Swap ETH → FAB
- **Liquidity pool**: FAB/ETH on Base L2
- URL: `app.uniswap.org` (select Base network)

**Option 2: Earn as a User**
- Use Platformless AI as a user (spend USDC/ETH)
- Earn FAB rewards (5% cashback in FAB tokens)
- Use earned FAB to stake as a host

**Option 3: Liquidity Mining**
- Provide liquidity to FAB/ETH pool on Uniswap
- Earn LP fees + FAB rewards
- Use rewards to stake

**Stake Lockup Period**:

- **No lockup** while you're an active host
- **7-day unbonding period** if you unregister

This means:
- You can increase stake anytime (no delay)
- You can unregister and get stake back, but must wait 7 days
- During unbonding, you cannot register as a host

**Why 7 days?**
Allows time for any pending disputes/slashing before funds are returned.

**Slashing Risk**:

Your stake can be slashed (partially confiscated) if:

**Minor Offense** (Warning → 10% slash):
- Going offline mid-job without unregistering
- Consistently slow response times (<50% of expected throughput)
- Failing to submit proofs for completed jobs

**Major Offense** (50% slash + delisting):
- Submitting fake/invalid STARK proofs
- Attempting to decrypt user prompts (privacy violation)
- Double-spending exploits
- Coordinated attacks on the network

**Example**:
- You stake 500 FAB
- You submit a fake proof (trying to cheat payment)
- Proof verification fails
- Smart contract slashes 250 FAB (50%)
- You're delisted from marketplace (must re-register with new stake)

**Slashing is RARE** if you:
- ✅ Run official node software (no modifications)
- ✅ Keep node online and responsive
- ✅ Don't try to game the system

**Refunding Your Stake**:

When you want to stop hosting:

```bash
./fabstir-host-cli unregister
# Initiates 7-day unbonding period
```

After 7 days:

```bash
./fabstir-host-cli withdraw-stake
# Returns 100 FAB (or remaining after slashing) to your wallet
```

**Important**: Unregistering does **not** affect your accumulated earnings (those are separate and withdrawable anytime).

**Future: Dynamic Staking**:

Planned for post-MVP:
- **Stake-weighted rewards**: Higher stake = proportionally higher earnings
- **Delegation**: Non-technical FAB holders can delegate stake to hosts (earn passive income)
- **Insurance pools**: Community-funded pools to compensate users if a host is slashed

**Summary**:

- **100 FAB minimum** to register (~$10)
- **Refundable** when you unregister (after 7 days)
- **Slashable** if you misbehave (rare if you follow rules)
- **Increasable** anytime to improve job priority

#### **Q5: How are payments settled?**

**Answer**:

Payments are settled **trustlessly via smart contracts** on Base L2. No platform, no middleman, no manual invoices. Everything is automated and cryptographically verifiable.

**End-to-End Settlement Flow**:

**1. User Deposits into Escrow**

User calls `JobMarketplace.createJob()`:
```solidity
function createJob(
  uint256 maxTokens,        // e.g., 10,000 tokens
  uint256 pricePerToken,    // e.g., 2000 (= $0.002 per token)
  bytes32 modelId,          // Model they want
  address paymentToken      // USDC, ETH, or FAB
) external payable
```

User sends:
- For ETH: `msg.value = maxTokens × pricePerToken` (in Wei)
- For USDC/FAB: Approve + transfer tokens to JobMarketplace

Funds are **locked in escrow** (not sent to host yet).

**2. Job Assignment**

Smart contract logic:
```solidity
// Find available hosts running the requested model
address[] memory availableHosts = nodeRegistry.getAvailableHosts(modelId);

// Select host (currently: first available, future: weighted by stake/reputation)
address selectedHost = availableHosts[0];

// Assign job
jobs[jobId].assignedHost = selectedHost;
emit JobAssigned(jobId, selectedHost);
```

**3. Host Completes Work**

Host generates inference + STARK proof, then submits checkpoint:

```solidity
function submitProofOfWork(
  uint256 jobId,
  uint256 tokensClaimed,    // e.g., 1000 tokens
  bytes32 proofHash,        // SHA256 of proof
  string calldata proofCID  // S5 content identifier
) external
```

**4. Proof Verification**

Smart contract verifies:
- ✅ Caller is the assigned host
- ✅ `tokensClaimed ≤ maxTokens` (not claiming more than allowed)
- ✅ `proofHash` matches what's stored in S5 (off-chain verification, on-chain soon)
- ✅ Job is still active (not expired/cancelled)

If all checks pass:

```solidity
// Calculate payment
uint256 payment = tokensClaimed × pricePerToken;

// Transfer from escrow to HostEarnings contract
hostEarnings.deposit(assignedHost, paymentToken, payment);

// Deduct from job's escrow balance
jobs[jobId].remainingEscrow -= payment;

// Emit event
emit ProofSubmitted(jobId, tokensClaimed, proofHash, proofCID);
```

**5. Funds Available in HostEarnings**

Payment is now in `HostEarnings` contract under your address:

```solidity
mapping(address host => mapping(address token => uint256 balance)) public balances;
```

Your balance increases instantly (confirmed in 2-5 seconds on Base L2).

**6. Host Withdraws**

Anytime, you can call:

```solidity
function withdraw(address token, uint256 amount) external {
  require(balances[msg.sender][token] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

  balances[msg.sender][token] -= amount;

  if (token == ETH_ADDRESS) {
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
  } else {
    IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amount);
  }

  emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, token, amount);
}
```

Funds are sent directly to your wallet (the one you used to register).

**Refund for Unused Escrow**:

If user deposited 10 USDC but only used 5,000 tokens (out of 10,000 max):

```solidity
function refundUnusedEscrow(uint256 jobId) external {
  require(msg.sender == jobs[jobId].user, "Not job owner");
  require(jobs[jobId].status == JobStatus.Completed, "Job not finished");

  uint256 refund = jobs[jobId].remainingEscrow;
  jobs[jobId].remainingEscrow = 0;

  payable(msg.sender).transfer(refund);

  emit RefundIssued(jobId, refund);
}
```

User gets back 5 USDC (automatically or by calling `refundUnusedEscrow()`).

**Platform Fee (5%)**:

A small network fee is deducted from payments:

```solidity
uint256 platformFee = payment × 5 / 100;  // 5%
uint256 hostEarnings = payment - platformFee;

treasury.deposit(platformFee);            // 5% to protocol treasury
hostEarnings.deposit(host, hostEarnings); // 95% to host
```

**Platform fee goes to**:
- Protocol development (smart contract upgrades)
- Liquidity incentives (FAB staking rewards)
- Governance treasury (FAB token holder controlled)

**Dispute Resolution** (Rare):

If user claims host didn't deliver:

1. User can challenge the proof (within 24 hours)
2. Proof is retrieved from S5 and verified on-chain (future: ZK proof verification)
3. If proof is invalid:
   - Payment is refunded to user
   - Host's stake is slashed
4. If proof is valid:
   - Challenge fails
   - Challenger loses challenge bond (spam prevention)

**Current status**: Manual review via governance (post-MVP: automated ZK proof verification)

**Gas Costs**:

| Transaction | Gas Cost (Base L2) | Who Pays |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| `createJob()` | ~$0.01 | User |
| `submitProofOfWork()` | ~$0.005 | Host (deducted from earnings) |
| `withdraw()` | ~$0.01 | Host |
| `refundUnusedEscrow()` | ~$0.005 | User |

Gas costs are **negligible** compared to earnings/payments.

**Settlement Speed**:

- **Block time**: ~2 seconds (Base L2)
- **Confirmation**: 1-3 blocks (~2-6 seconds)
- **Total time**: Work completed → funds available = **Under 10 seconds**

Compare to:
- Traditional platforms: 30-90 days (invoicing, payment processing)
- Crypto exchanges: Instant, but requires trust + KYC
- Platformless AI: **Instant, trustless, no KYC**

**Transparency**:

All payments are publicly verifiable:
- **BaseScan**: View all transactions for your address
- **ProofSubmitted events**: See every payment released
- **HostEarnings balance**: On-chain query (no hidden state)

**Multi-Token Support**:

Smart contracts support multiple payment tokens:
- **ETH** (native Base L2 token)
- **USDC** (stablecoin, most common)
- **FAB** (platform token, discounted fees)

Users choose, hosts receive the same token.

**Future Enhancements** (Post-MVP):

- **Streaming micropayments**: Pay per token (not per 1000)
- **Payment channels**: Off-chain payment batching (even cheaper)
- **Cross-chain payments**: Accept payment on Ethereum, pay host on Base
- **Automated withdrawals**: Threshold-based withdrawals (e.g., auto-withdraw when > 10 USDC)

**Security Guarantees**:

✅ **Non-custodial**: Funds are in smart contracts, not a company's bank account
✅ **Trustless**: No admin key can steal funds
✅ **Immutable**: Payment logic can't be changed (contract is final)
✅ **Audited**: Smart contracts are audited (post-MVP: public audit report)

**Summary**:

Settlement is:
- ⚡ **Instant** (~10 seconds work → payment)
- 🔒 **Trustless** (smart contracts, no middleman)
- 🌐 **Transparent** (all payments visible on-chain)
- 💰 **Cheap** (gas fees < $0.01 per transaction)
- 🛡️ **Secure** (cryptographic proofs + slashing for fraud)
